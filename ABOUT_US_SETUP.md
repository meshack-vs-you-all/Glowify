   - Add your custom content (it will override the default)

### Step 2: Assign the Template
1. In the page editor, scroll down to "Search engine listing preview"
2. Click "Change" next to "Template"
3. Select "page.about" from the dropdown
4. Click "Save"

### Step 3: Add to Navigation
1. Go to Shopify Admin → Online Store → Navigation
2. Click on "Main menu" (or your main navigation menu)
3. Click "Add menu item"
4. Name: "About Us" (or "About")
5. Link: Select the page you just created
6. Click "Add"
7. Drag to position it where you want in the menu

## Alternative: Direct Link
If you want to add it manually to the header, you can edit the navigation menu in Theme Customizer:
1. Go to Theme Customizer → Header section
2. Edit the navigation menu
3. Add "About Us" link pointing to `/pages/about-us` (or your page handle)

## Default Content
The template includes default content about Glowify:
- Introduction: "Where Little Moments Become Big Memories"
- Our Mission
- What We Stand For (Safety, Quality, Design, Customer Care)
- Our Story
- Call to Action (Get in Touch)

You can customize this content in the page editor or by editing the template file.
