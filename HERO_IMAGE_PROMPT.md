# Hero Section Image Generation Prompt

## For AI Image Generation Models (Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, etc.)

### Primary Prompt:

```
A beautiful, professional hero banner image for a baby products e-commerce store called "Glowify". The scene features a modern, minimalist lifestyle setting with soft, natural lighting. In the center, showcase a premium baby stroller (similar to the "Amazing Product" stroller style) positioned elegantly. The background should be clean and uncluttered - either a soft pastel color (sage green, cream, or light beige) or a subtle blurred natural setting like a park or modern home interior. The overall mood should be warm, peaceful, and premium. The image should have space on the left or right side for text overlay. Style: professional product photography, soft focus background, sharp focus on the stroller, warm color palette, high-end lifestyle aesthetic. Aspect ratio: 16:9 (1920x1080px for desktop), warm and inviting atmosphere.
```

### Alternative Prompt (More Detailed):

A premium baby stroller (modern design, neutral colors like sage green, cream, or soft gray) positioned in the center-left of the frame. Soft, natural daylight lighting from the side. Background: blurred, dreamy lifestyle setting - either a modern minimalist living room with plants, or a peaceful park scene with soft bokeh. Color palette: warm sage greens (#7C9885), cream whites, soft beiges, gentle pastels. The stroller should be the focal point, sharp and detailed. Leave 40% of the right side of the image as negative space for text overlay. Style: high-end product photography, lifestyle aesthetic, warm and inviting, premium feel.
